    <p><h2>Early musical career</h2> <br>
        <b>Kenshi Yonezu</b> was born on March 10, 1991, in the rural part of Tokushima, Japan. As a child, Yonezu found it difficult to communicate with other people, especially his father. Yonezu typically felt that his mother understood him.[citation needed] He was diagnosed with autism after the age of 20[3][4] and also has Marfan 
        <br>
        
         Yonezu's first foray into music was in 2006 during his second year of junior high school, where he formed a band with his friend Hiroshi Nakajima, called Late Rabbit Edda, to play for the school culture festival.[6][7][8][9] He worked as the vocalist, songwriter and occasional guitarist, while Nakajima was the guitarist. In late 2007, he set up a website for the band, posting song lyrics and short novels.[10] Yonezu wrote songs for the band, and between April 2008 and March 2009 uploaded 24 original songs to video sharing website Nico Nico Douga using the name Hachi.[2] None of the songs were widely viewed, with the greatest, "Beelzebub," receiving only 23,000 views.[11] Yonezu created his blog in this period, and called it Tekitō Edda (適当EDDA).[12][13] <br>
        
        Yonezu moved to Osaka after high school, and started attending a fine arts school.[14] While a student there, he started uploading songs using Vocaloid software Hatsune Miku instead, which were increasingly popular. His 2009 song "Musunde Hiraite Rasetsu to Mukuro" (結ンデ開イテ羅刹ト骸) was his first song to receive over 1,000,000 views on the site.[15] Though Yonezu had uploaded over 30 songs sung by himself, he deleted them when his Vocaloid songs became more popular.[6] Yonezu renamed his blog Denshi-chō Hachibangai (電子帖八番, "Electronic Notebook 8th Avenue"), and it was one of five blogs awarded the Diamond Award at the 2009 WebMoney Awards.[16] <br>
        
        In December 2009, Yonezu's song "Clock Lock Works" was featured on an Exit Tunes compilation album, Supernova, the first time a song of his appeared on an album. In January, "Musunde Hiraite Rasetsu to Mukuro" was featured on Vocalolegend feat. Hatsune Miku, Exit Tunes' second Oricon top 10 compilation album.[17] Yonezu released two self-produced albums in 2010: Hanataba to Suisō in February, and Official Orange in November. In 2010 and 2011, Yonezu's songs were featured on many Exit Tunes albums, including Vocalonexus feat. Hatsune Miku, which was the second Vocaloid album to reach number one on Oricon's albums chart.[18] His songs were featured on the games Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Extend (2011) and Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F (2012), and in the Hatsune Miku concert Miku no Hi Dankanshasai (2012), which became the first number one DVD/Blu-ray for a virtual singer.[19] On Hachi's Nico Nico account, seven of his songs have been viewed more than 1,000,000 times,[20] including the song "Matryoshka," which had reached 5,000,000 views by 2012.[21] <br>
        
        In April 2010, Yonezu joined the animation collective Minakata Kenkyūjo (南方研究所, "Minakata Laboratory"), a group that he had worked with since his "Clock Lock Works" video in November 2009.[22] On January 23, 2011, Yonezu uploaded his final Hachi Vocaloid video for approximately three  <br>

        Late Rabbit Edda remained active until 2010. They were renamed Ernst Eckman, and added a drummer called Sumimoto to their line up. As Ernst Eckman, they released a single song on MySpace, "Oborozuki to Sono Kōan" (オボロヅキとその考案, "Crescent Moon and that Plan").[23] Yonezu began to feel that he did not work well with other people, and decided to work alone on Vocaloid songs exclusively, giving up on being a part of a band.[24]</p>
